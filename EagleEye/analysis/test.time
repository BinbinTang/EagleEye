To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:37:22		"Hi I'm liYin, so I call you via whatsapp and you'll wake up?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:42:42		"Actual US number:
+1 (415) 797-8487

What you should call IFF you are using Singtel:
019 1 415 797 8487"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:42:59		"Are u using Singtel?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:45:09		"019 only works for Singtel. If it is another carrier, there is another number prefix."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:45:19		"I won't pick up so there shouldn't be any call charge.

If for some reason the mobile picks up, u should hang up immediately. Coz I won't pick up.

019 ensures that call charges are minimal (just in case) at about $10/hr.

I will pay u back if there are call charges."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:47:05		"I see. Mine is starhub. 018 should be the prefix"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-21 23:48:27		"Sometimes there are a few tiers. Singtel has 3 tiers - 001 something n 019. And 019 is cheapest. Useful knowledge for future."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-26 23:04:39		"Hi, Chen Liang, did you finish your testimonial sample for marek and prof. Deng to sign on?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 00:07:47		"Still working on work. Sorry about delay. ETA by today."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 00:09:22		"OK£¨can. Just to update you on the current situation, only 4 of us responded to this quest, and I suspect only 4 members are left for our team."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 00:11:12		"So Wei xiong and I think we can no longer hide the truth from the committee and instead should let them know about NTU's participation. We might still hope they will sponsor us since its reduced amont for them. Yet we have tougher time convincing them about our commitment to this competition."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 00:11:51		"Your suggestions?"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 00:15:37		"You'll stay right?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 03:10:57		"The fact as it is, is this:
There were 6 NUS students wanting to compete.
Now. There are 4 NUS students wanting to compete.
So we have some blank spots right now, and we are consulting ACRC on the way to proceed in filling them up.
That's the only thing that has changed.

The things that have not changed, and are the main focus of our proposal:
We are NUS students.
We intend to make Supercomputing a substantial feature of NUS.
We need sponsorship in order to compete."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:50:03		"So it doesn't really affect us."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:49:27		"I believe there's no need to mention NTU."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:48:58		"It's a simple case. Just say that 2 ppl dropped out coz of commitments issues."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:50:35		"Mentioning NTU could complicate things."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:49:53		"It's an issue from 2 people, not an issue from the rest of us."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 02:50:16		"Yes, I'm staying."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-27 16:53:55		"I'm done with Prof Deng, not sure what to write for Marek :("
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:03:55		"My work just ended. Continuing the writing on the form."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:18:03		"Ok. Thanks."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:23:26		"Btw do u know whats the meaning of SC?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:23:37		"Is it Supercomputing?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:23:44		"Supercomputing Conference?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:23:53		"Supercomputing Competition?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 11:24:01		"Superconputers?"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 12:03:27		"Sc stands for supercomputing conference. SCC stands for student cluster competition"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 12:04:42		"Where did u get the SC from? I've been finding it for a while but it doesn't seem to be written on the web."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:33:05		"I can't remember why I believe SC for supercomputing conference. It's not on the event main page? They are so fond of acronyms"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:42:37		"The SC acronym is one of the biggest mysteries not listed lol."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:43:08		"You probably have that impression because the front page has SC Conference."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:43:22		"Then S looks like it could be Supercomputer."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:43:28		"Check their past history like sc12, sc13"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:43:42		"And see whether they have the exact wording"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 15:46:59		"I think sc is the conference name by itself lol"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-30 20:43:39		"Hey have you send me your forms and supporting document?"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-05-31 00:11:52		"Ah, I suppose you will submit by yourself. I will give the signed testimonials to you."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-02 09:17:24		"NTU haven't fully onboard and their advisor haven't planned out anything yet. We'll go with Prof Deng's original plan and see how."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-02 09:35:32		"Ok."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-05 14:55:30		"Pls give me the call 10 minutes before u start. Thanks.

Gonna sleep now.

Don't reply to this message, or I will get a notification."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-09 22:48:31		"Hi, add sc14nus in your Skype contact"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-09 22:51:26		"As said before, I'll call you to ring you up. Then wait you on Skype."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 03:17:12		"Call me til I SMS you :)"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 03:17:29		"If I cancel your call and SMS you, it means I've woken up."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 19:47:51		"Ok"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 19:53:13		"You dialing in?"

From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:04:38		"What is your Skype?"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:06:31		"sc14nus"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:09:21		"Added"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:09:27		"Do you see it?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:10:41		"NUS is offline"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-10 20:25:26		"Disconnected"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-12 20:18:17		"You wake up?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-12 23:46:48		"I was supposed to take a power nap at 2:30am my time, 5:30pm SG time.

Woke up at 7am my time :/"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-12 23:47:12		"Was power napping on the chair, so I thought I would wake up."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 00:12:04		"It's fine. We were all issued an account for access hpc servers. However currently can only access through ACRC network or VPN. Btw I've sent you matlab installation info. Check it out. Matlab application is also released and can be downloaded from ftp://anonymous:simulink@ftp.mathworks.com/outgoing/norris/scc/
Instruction for this application can be found in HTML folder when you unzip"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 00:12:28		"Ok"

To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:31:01		"The one which we click to add mailing list?"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:31:36		"What's about it?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:31:49		"No. Example:
liyin@gmail.com
liyin+someWord@gmail.com"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:32:12		"No. What does it do?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:32:24		"Try it"
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:32:42		"I can't access gmail now..."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:32:54		"Basically, mail to chenliang.dev gets blocked. Goes straight to spam."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:33:24		"I usually email to your nus account"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:33:39		"I think it was for the Matlab account thing."

To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:34:56		"Wait are you talking about candy's email or my email?"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:34:44		"I received it because I checked the spam mail."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:35:11		"I think Candy."
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:35:40		"Not sure what was the Matlab person's name."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:35:46		"I sent to your school mail."

From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:36:04		"Maybe it was Kevin."
To	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:36:15		"Two entities issued us matlab account"
From:Ch	Ch (6593667325)	2014-06-13 14:36:22		"Coz u mentioned google group. Maybe he took the email addr from there."

Run and optimise CPU-only HPL, downloadable from netlib.org or you can find pre-compiled binaries from /apps/intel/mkl/benchmarks/mp_linpack/bin_intel/intel64
Run and optimise CUDA-enabled HPL (if you use the binary from me, you would need openmpi - install openmpi from source code in your directory)
Install NAMD on your $HOME directory
Install ADCIRC on your $HOME directory
Install MATLAB (optional)
Deliverables:

Submit your output files, log files, input files, and test results (for each application) on the /apps/students directory (make a directory yourname_username)."
