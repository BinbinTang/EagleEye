        Claude Monet, also known as Oscar-Claude Monet or Claude Oscar Monet
        was born to Adolphe and Louise-Justine Monet of 45 Rue Laffitte, 
        in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. 
        <p>
            He was christened as Oscar-Claude at the church of 
            Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. His father wanted him to go into the family 
            (grocery store) business, but Claude Monet wanted to become an artist. 
            His mother was a singer, both parents were second-generation Parisians.

        Monet died December 5, 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the Giverny 
        church cemetery. His famous home and garden with its waterlily pond and bridge 
        at Giverny are a popular drawcard for tourists. In the house there are many 
        examples of Japanese woodcut prints on the walls.
